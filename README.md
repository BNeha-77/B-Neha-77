# B-Neha-77
I'm a dedicated student with expertise in python
I'm passionate about full stack development and committed to delivering high - quality solutions.

Technical skills :
Programming Languages: python, c
Development Framework: Django
Tools and Technologies: VS Code, IDLE, Dev C++ , Microsoft 365

Projects:

1) Detecting the movement of the object with webcam.  
Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, Data time
 A motion detector is a device that detects moving objects, particularly people. Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. An occupancy sensor detects the presence of an entity within a certain space. And my role in this project was I am the Team Leader.

2) Identifying genetic disorders in children through automated pupillometry analysis.
 Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Python-tkinter
  The system integrates a pupillometer with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify pupillometric features for each eye. Tested for Retinitis Pigmentosa, the ensemble model achieved 84.6% accuracy, 93.7% sensitivity, and 78.6% specificity, making it the first study to apply machine learning to pupillometry for genetic disease diagnosis in children.

3) AI-Driven Early Disease Outbreak Detection.
 AI-Driven Early Disease Outbreak Detection leverages artificial intelligence to analyze real-time data from various sources like healthcare records, social media, and environmental sensors. It enables rapid identification of potential outbreaks before they escalate. This proactive approach enhances public health response and containment strategies.

4)EV Energy Prediction.
EV Energy Prediction is a project that uses machine learning to forecast the energy consumption of electric vehicles. It analyzes factors like driving behavior, speed, distance, and weather conditions. The goal is to optimize energy usage and support efficient EV charging infrastructure.
