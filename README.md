Projects

Detecting The Movement Of The Object With Webcam Python
• A motion detector is a device that detects moving objects, particularly people. Such a device is often 
integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an 
area. An occupancy sensor detects the presence of an entity within a certain space. And my role in this project 
was I am the Team Leader.

 Identifying Genetic Disorders In Children Through Automated Pupillometry Analysis Python 
• The system integrates a pupillometer with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify pupillometric features 
for each eye. Tested for Retinitis Pigmentosa, the ensemble model achieved 84.6% accuracy, 93.7% sensitivity, 
and 78.6% specificity, making it the first study to apply machine learning to pupillometry for genetic disease 
diagnosis in children.

AI-Driven Early Disease Outbreak Detection (AI) Python ,Django
• AI-Driven Early Disease Outbreak Detection leverages artificial intelligence to analyze real-time data from various 
sources like healthcare records, social media, and environmental sensors. It enables rapid identification of potential 
outbreaks before they escalate. This proactive approach enhances public health response and 
containment strategies.

EV Energy Prediction (AI) Python , Django
• EV Energy Prediction is a project that uses machine learning to forecast the energy consumption of electric vehicles. 
It analyzes factors like driving behavior, speed, distance, and weather conditions. The goal is to optimize energy 
usage and support efficient EV charging infrastructure.
